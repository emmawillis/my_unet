Dataset split complete! 67 patients in train, 17 in test.

test images: 148
test masks: 148
    8 gleason-3
    7 gleason-4
    25 gleason-5
    108 healthy

train images: 565
train masks: 569
    83 gleason-3
    19 gleason-4
    14 gleason-5
    453 healthy


Gleason is gleason GRADE GROUP ie we dont know the specific pattern combination found in the histo
HOWEVER we do have the primary/secondary score in the biopsy sheet, so we could look that up
but those are at cell level. here we're segmenting the entire lesion, so not the most helpful to know score

when there were multiple biopsies from the same lesion, we take most frequently occuring score (w/ highest score as tie breaker)

The International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) has introduced a simplified system of 5 Grade Groups
to better classify prostate cancer, with each Grade Group corresponding to a range of Gleason scores. 
Grade Group 1: Gleason scores 3+3 = 6 
Grade Group 2: Gleason score 3+4 = 7 
Grade Group 3: Gleason score 4+3 = 7 
Grade Group 4: Gleason scores 4+4, 3+5, 5+3 = 8 
Grade Group 5: Gleason scores 4+5, 5+4, 5+5 = 9/10 



--------
Dataloader
we are having the model predict 4 channels
where index 0 represents healthy, 1 is g3, 2 is g4, and 3 is g5
so our unet input channels will be 3 (rgb) and output channels will be 4, each a binary mask 



Training:
Input: 3-channel 256x256 RGB images
Output: 4-class binary segmentation masks
Loss Function: CrossEntropyLoss
Optimizer: Adam -> adagrad + RMSprop
     -> keep moving average of gradients and squared gradients for each individual weight.

Z-score normalization

Why Use Z-Score Normalization for MRI?
MRI images have high intensity variations due to:

Differences in scanner hardware (Siemens, GE, Philips, etc.).
Acquisition protocols (T1, T2, DWI, etc.).
Variability in contrast agent usage.
Differences in patient anatomy.
Z-score normalization helps by: ✅ Standardizing the intensity distribution across different scans.
✅ Reducing scanner-related variations, making the model focus on anatomical structures.
✅ Improving generalization across different datasets/hospitals.

This is especially useful for multi-center datasets, where different institutions may have slightly different image intensities.
