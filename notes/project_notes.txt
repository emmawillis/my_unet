Gleason is gleason GRADE GROUP ie we dont know the specific pattern combination found in the histo
HOWEVER we do have the primary/secondary score in the biopsy sheet, so we could look that up
but those are at cell level. here we're segmenting the entire lesion, so not the most helpful to know score

when there were multiple biopsies from the same lesion, we take most frequently occuring score (w/ highest score as tie breaker)

The International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) has introduced a simplified system of 5 Grade Groups
to better classify prostate cancer, with each Grade Group corresponding to a range of Gleason scores. 
Grade Group 1: Gleason scores 3+3 = 6 
Grade Group 2: Gleason score 3+4 = 7 
Grade Group 3: Gleason score 4+3 = 7 
Grade Group 4: Gleason scores 4+4, 3+5, 5+3 = 8 
Grade Group 5: Gleason scores 4+5, 5+4, 5+5 = 9/10
